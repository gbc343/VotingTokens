# VotingTokens

This is my VotingToken contract. It works by allowing the contract owner to approve potential voters who apply for the right to vote on one of the presented proposals. If approved they will recieve a set of newly minted ERC20 tokens curtesy of the owner which will give them the right to vote.

It runs on hardhat but you will be required to install node modules upon downloading the project. You can do so via the npm install command.
